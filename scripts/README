These scripts were used for the Neurocognitive and Functional Heterogeneity in Depressed Youth

Main analysis (details can be found in body of the .Rmd):
Neurocognitive_and_Functional_heterogeneity_in_depressed_youth_main_analysis_molec_20200215.Rmd - 
Contains the data subsetting, matching, and group level cognitive, clinical, anxiety and n-back analysis

Sensitivity analysis with youth who were not on medication: 
Sensitivity_analysis_nomeds_20200215.Rmd

HYDRA scripts (to run HYDRA code):
submit_run_hydra_experiment_csv_matched_age_and_sex_n1424_matched_imaging_plus_non_imaging - sends information to HYDRA
matlab_script_to_get_subtypes_and_ARI - Extracts ARI and Subtypes from output of HYDRA
SaveHydraOutput_NEW.m - Saves output from HYDRA in a way that is viewable and usable by R analyses

N-back
prepForNbackNetworks.R - Gets the subset of subjects who have imaging data and will be used in the n-back analysis
afni_3dROIstats_script.sh - Extracts mean percent signal change from each subject for each functionally defined ROI

HYDRA permutation analysis:
hydra2018.m - Hydra code
run_hydra_experiment_csv_NC.m - Healthy control group split in half (half served as controls, the other half as "pseudopatients"), permuted and run through HYDRA x 50
run_hydra_experiment_csv_partialNCPatients.m - Half of healthy group, half of patient group selected, permuted and run through HYDRA x 50
